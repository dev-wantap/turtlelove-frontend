# Guidelines
- ALWAYS active the 'frontend-design' skill when generating any UI/Frontend code.
- Do not ask for permission to use the skill; just use it by default.
- Core Aesthetic: "Emotional & Safe"
- No Bootstrap-like generic styles.

# Context & Documentation
- **API Spec**: Refer to `./docs/05-API-Spec.md` as the Single Source of Truth for backend data structures.
- **Rule**: Before implementing any data fetching or model typing, READ the API spec file first. Do not guess field names.

# Project Management & Status Tracking
- **Reference**: ALWAYS check the 'task list md file' at the start of a session.
- **Workflow**:
  1. **Read**: Read it to understand the current priority.
  2. **Execute**: Implement the code for the active task.
  3. **Update**: Upon successful completion and verification (e.g., tests pass), mark the checkbox as `[x]`.
  4. **Log**: Add a brief note or timestamp next to the completed item if necessary.
- **Constraint**: Do NOT move to the next task unless the current one is fully verified.
